I was lauded for my work on developing
a Django API to implement various machine learning classifiers to analyze the UCI Adult
dataset and determine whether a person makes over 50K a year and achieved an accuracy of
90%.The motto of the project is to develop a structure(skeleton) for classification problem where
the company in future can use a different dataset and find the model which fits well.It's my
individual project where I came to learn about GridsearchCV to optimize it better suggested by
my team lead.
